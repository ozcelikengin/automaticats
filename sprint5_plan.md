- [ ] Integrate ML predictions with the feeding schedule system
- [ ] Implement "smart schedule" feature for automated adjustments
- [ ] Add confidence levels for recommendations

### 4. UI Enhancements

- [ ] Develop integration tests for recommendation system
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test the system with various feeding scenarios
- [ ] Validate accuracy against predetermined metrics

### Database Extensions
```sql
-- New table for ML features
CREATE TABLE feeding_metrics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    cat_id INTEGER,
    timestamp DATETIME,
    meal_duration INTEGER,
    consumption_rate REAL,
    leftover_amount REAL,
    mood_before TEXT,
    mood_after TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (cat_id) REFERENCES cats(id)
);

-- Table for model predictions
CREATE TABLE feeding_predictions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    cat_id INTEGER,
    prediction_type TEXT,
    predicted_value REAL,
    confidence_level REAL,
    timestamp DATETIME,
    accepted BOOLEAN,
    actual_value REAL,
    FOREIGN KEY (cat_id) REFERENCES cats(id)
);
```

### ML Module Structure

- `models/`: Directory containing trained models
- `prediction_service.py`: Service for generating recommendations
- `feedback_processor.py`: Processing user feedback to improve models

### Required Dependencies
- scikit-learn>=1.0.2
- numpy>=1.22.0
- pandas>=1.4.0
- matplotlib>=3.5.0
- tensorflow-lite (optional for more advanced models)
