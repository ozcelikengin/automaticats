# Sprint 1 Completion Summary: Research & Planning

## Sprint Goal
Define system architecture, choose technology stack, and identify key data tracking requirements for the AutomatiCats application.

## Achievements

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up GitHub repository
   - Created initial project structure
   - Defined coding standards and naming conventions
   - Established branch management strategy

2. **Technology Stack Selection**
   - Selected Python as primary development language
   - Chose Qt (PyQt6) for GUI framework
   - Selected SQLite for local database
   - Determined testing frameworks (unittest, pytest)

3. **Architecture Design**
   - Designed database schema for cat profiles, feeding schedules, and food inventory
   - Created system architecture diagram with core components
   - Defined interfaces between UI and backend components
   - Established modular design approach for extensibility

4. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Conducted user needs analysis for cat feeding management
   - Identified key data points for cat profiles (name, age, weight, breed, dietary needs)
   - Defined feeding schedule requirements and configuration options
   - Outlined food inventory tracking requirements

5. **Research & Prototyping**
   - Researched existing cat feeding solutions and their limitations
   - Created paper prototypes for UI layout
   - Tested database schema with sample data
   - Prototyped core feeding schedule algorithm

## Technical Documentation

1. **System Architecture**
   - Core components: Database Manager, Cat Manager, Feeding Scheduler, UI Components
   - Data flow diagram between components
   - Database schema with tables and relationships
   - API documentation for core services

2. **Technology Choices**
   - Python 3.9+ for broad compatibility
   - PyQt6 for cross-platform GUI capabilities
   - SQLite for lightweight embedded database
   - JSON for configuration and data export/import

## Sprint Backlog Refinement

The product backlog was refined with the following detailed tasks:

1. **Database Implementation**
   - Create SQLite database schema
   - Implement DatabaseManager class
   - Add methods for CRUD operations on cats, schedules, and inventory
   - Implement data persistence and backup

2. **Core Logic**
   - Design feeding schedule algorithms
   - Create notification system for alerts
   - Develop food inventory tracking logic
   - Implement multi-cat management

3. **UI Design**
   - Create main application window
   - Design cat management tab
   - Design feeding schedule tab
   - Design inventory management tab
   - Design statistics and reporting tab

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Ensuring cross-platform compatibility
   **Solution**: Selected Qt framework for GUI development which provides native look and feel across platforms

2. **Challenge**: Managing different feeding requirements for multiple cats
   **Solution**: Designed flexible data model to accommodate various feeding patterns and individual cat needs

3. **Challenge**: Data persistence and reliability
   **Solution**: Implemented SQLite with transaction support and regular backup mechanisms

## Next Steps

The team is ready to move into Sprint 2 with a clear focus on:

1. Implementing the core database functionality
2. Developing the feeding schedule logic
3. Creating the basic UI components
4. Setting up the data persistence layer

## Conclusion

Sprint 1 successfully established the foundation for the AutomatiCats project with clear architecture decisions, technology choices, and detailed requirements. The team has a solid understanding of the problem domain and has created a well-structured plan for implementation. The groundwork laid during this sprint will enable efficient development in subsequent sprints.
