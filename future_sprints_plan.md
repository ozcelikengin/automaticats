- Smart home integration adoption (target: >30% of users connecting to smart home devices)
- User satisfaction with multi-user functionality (target: >4.5/5 rating)

## Risk Management

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| ML recommendations inaccuracy | Medium | High | Implement confidence thresholds and user feedback mechanisms |
| Cloud security vulnerabilities | Low | High | Regular security audits and encryption implementation |
| Mobile app performance issues | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing on various devices and optimize data usage |
| Smart home integration complexity | High | Medium | Prioritize popular platforms and use standard APIs |
| User resistance to cloud features | Medium | Medium | Make cloud features optional and emphasize privacy measures |

## Conclusion

This future sprints plan outlines the path forward for implementing the advanced features identified in Epic 5 of the product backlog. Each sprint builds upon the previous ones, with a focus on delivering incremental value to users while managing technical complexity and risks.

The plan allows for flexibility and adjustment based on user feedback and changing requirements, adhering to the agile principles of the scrum framework. Regular reviews and retrospectives will ensure that the development remains aligned with user needs and expectations.
